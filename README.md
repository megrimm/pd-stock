#stock trading abstractions for puredata

a pure data abstraction library for algorithmic trading.

Use at your own risk. I can not guarantee that anything works properly.

If you are interested in contributing please fork, fix things, add stuff by staying consistant with the given naming stratagy, and then send me a pull request.

This is quite a mess and is really just a bunch of experiments. I was using pyext to make bitcoin trades through gdax. Probaby nothing works at this point. 

Ideally this library would be math stuffs that construct trading stratagies. Rigt now its just moving averages stuff and the MACD momentum indicator.
