#X text 283 22 The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator
developed by noted technical analyst Welles Wilder \, that compares
the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period
to measure speed and change of price movements of a security. It is
primarily used to attempt to identify overbought or oversold conditions
in the trading of an asset.;
#X text 290 309 RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS) RS = Average Gain / Average
Loss;
#X text 284 117 The RSI provides a relative evaluation of the strength
of a security's recent price performance \, thus making it a momentum
indicator. RSI values range from 0 to 100 The default time frame for
comparing up periods to down periods is 14 \, as in 14 trading days.

#X text 286 192 Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI is
that RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming
overbought or overvalued \, and therefore may be primed for a trend
reversal or corrective pullback in price. On the other side of RSI
values \, an RSI reading of 30 or below is commonly interpreted as
indicating an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend
change or corrective price reversal to the upside.;
#X text 290 346 The very first calculations for average gain and average
loss are simple 14 period averages. First Average Gain = Sum of Gains
over the past 14 periods / 14 First Average Loss = Sum of Losses over
the past 14 periods / 14 The second \, and subsequent \, calculations
are based on the prior averages and the current gain loss: Average
Gain = [(previous Average Gain) x 13 + current Gain] / 14 Average Loss
= [(previous Average Loss) x 13 + current Loss] / 14;
